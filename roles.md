# Village Team

## Villager
* **TEAM:** Village
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Good
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** No

You're just an Average person with no special powers who is trying to rid your community of evil. Then again, you may not be. Many of the special roles in the game start out with the player thinking themselves to be "just a villager" and have the potential to evolve along very different lines (for example, [Cursed](#cursed), [Drunk](#drunk) or [Shapeshifter](#shapeshifter).

On the other hand, even if you truly ARE just a plain Villager, you can still have a big impact on the game because you won't need to concoct an elaborate story and/or be a good actor when you're interrogated about your role. This allows you to play the game more loosely than most of the players with "power roles" and gives you a better chance of gaining useful information for your team.


### Cursed
* **TEAM:** Starts as Village
* **RACE:** Starts as Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Starts as Good
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** No*

You start the game thinking you're just another [Villager](#villager), with no special powers. However, if you're the target of the Wolf team's kill, you will NOT be killed that Night. Instead, on the FOLLOWING Night you'll be transformed into a standard Werewolf, with all the powers and characteristics of the new role. The Day phase after you were targeted by wolves will be the last one you'll experience as a human Villager. The next night, the Moderator will inform you of your new status and inform the other werewolves that they have a new teammate. You'll assist in that night's pack kill, and from then on you'll be considered a [Werewolf](#werewolf).

Two additional points:
* You can only be transformed by the Wolf team's pack kill. Any other death will NOT trigger the transformation.
* You are seen as Good/Human until your actual transformation on the night after being targeted by the pack. After that, you are seen as Evil/Wolf in accordance with your new role.



### Doppleganger
* **TEAM:** Starts as Village
* **RACE:** Starts as Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Starts as Good
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** No*

You start the game thinking you're just another [Villager](#villager) with no special powers. However, you assume the role of the first player executed. The night following the first execution, the Moderator will inform your new role, and you will play the remainder of the game as that role.

### Drunk
* **TEAM:** Starts as Village
* **RACE:** Starts as Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Starts as Good
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** No*

You start the game thinking you're just another [Villager](#villager) with no special powers. At the start of the third night, however, you will break out of your drunken haze and learn your true role via the Moderator. You will play the remainder of the game as that role.

### Ghost
* **TEAM:** Village
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Good
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** No

You are just an ordinary [Villager](#villager) until you die. Once you are killed by any means, you become a Ghost and select a player to haunt! From that point on, the haunted player's vote counts twice. However, the extra vote is only revealed in circumstances where it matters such as creating or
breaking a tie. The haunted player is not aware they are haunted and you are requied to abide by all other rules for being dead. You are not considered "restless-dead"

### Shapeshifter
* **TEAM:** Starts as Village
* **RACE:** Starts as Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Starts as Good
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** No*

You start the game thinking you're just another [Villager](#villager) with no special powers. At the start of the third night, you assume the role of whichever player was first killed by the wolves. If no kills have occurred, then you turn into an ordinary villager, none the wiser.


## Seer
* **TEAM:** Village
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Good
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** Yes

You just might be the most powerful member of the Village team. Each night, you'll pick a player to scan. The Moderator will then tell you if that player is a wolf or not. Your power is tempered somewhat by the following caveats:

* The [Alpha Wolf](#alpha-wolf) (a wolf, of course) is initially seen as "not a wolf," although a second reading will yield the truth.
* The [Lycan](#lycan) (NOT a wolf) is intially seen as a wolf, although a second reading will yield the truth.
* All human allies of the Wolf team such as the Sorcerer, the Harlot, etc. are seen as "not a wolf."
* There are other types of Seer (see below) that have faulty powers
* You'll tend to have more knowledge than any other player in the game, thus making you a prime target for the opposition.
* It is possible for a large game to have multiple Seers. If so, each Seer will operate independently; no information will be shared and they are not made aware of each others' identities.

### Apprentice Seer
* **TEAM:** Village
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Good
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** Yes (if the Seer dies)

The Apprentice Seer will assume the role of the [Seer](#seer) if the Seer is killed. Until that point, you are a standard Villager with no special powers. The Moderator will notify you when the Seer is killed. The Sorcerer will see you as the Seer only after you have assumed that role.

### Insane Seer
* **TEAM:** Village
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Good
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** Yes

Each night, you may choose a target to scan like a [Seer](#seer). However, you always get incorrect scan results. You believe yourself to be a normal Seer.

### Naive Seer
* **TEAM:** Village
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Good
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** Yes

Each night, you may choose a target to scan like a [Seer](#seer). However, you will always get "innocent" results, regardless of who is investigated. You believe yourself to be a normal Seer.

### Paranoid Seer
* **TEAM:** Village
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Good
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** Yes

Each night, you may choose a target to scan like a [Seer](#seer). However, you will always get "guilty" results, regardless of who is investigated. You believe yourself to be a normal Seer.

## Bodyguard
* **TEAM:** Village
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Good
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** Yes

Each night, you may choose a player, and ALL attempts to kill that player (except for suicide - see below) will fail.

Suicide can be committed by several roles, most notably [Martyr](#martyr), [Disciple](#disciple), [Siblings](#siblings).

In addition:
* You can't protect the same player on consecutive nights.
* You can't elect to protect yourself.
* You **CAN** elect not to protect anyone at all.
* There are other types of Bodyguard (see below) that have faulty powers

### Amateur Bodyguard
* **TEAM:** Village
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Good
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** Yes

You may protect a player each night (like the [Bodyguard](#bodyguard)) but if you target an active member of the wolf team to protect, YOU are killed. Your death is reported as a normal werewolf kill. You think that you are a regular Bodyguard.

### Sacrificial Bodyguard
* **TEAM:** Village
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Good
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** Yes

You may protect a player each night (like the [Bodyguard](#bodyguard)) but if the wolves target your protection target, then YOU die instead. You think that you are a regular Bodyguard.

### Paranoid Bodyguard
* **TEAM:** Village
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Good
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** Yes

Each night, you may choose a player to protect, like the [Bodyguard](#bodyguard). However, the "protected" player is also prevented from taking any nighttime action (like the Harlot). You think that you are a regular Bodyguard.

## Alchemist
* **TEAM:** Village
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Good
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** No

At the start of the game, choose another player. If you are executed that Player is poisoned and dies too.

## Aura Seer
* **TEAM:** Village
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Good
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** Yes

Each night, you may choose a player. The Moderator will tell you if the chosen player has a role with special powers (See: [Seer](#seer)) 

## Campaigner
* **TEAM:** Village
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Good
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** No

You are an ordinary villager, but you are also good at gaining support for your cause. Twice per game, you may have your vote count double. Do this by telling the moderator before the end of the day.

When you choose to have your vote count double and you end up successfully executing a player, the Moderator will inform everyone that there was a campaigner.

## Clairvoyant
* **TEAM:** Village
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Good
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** Yes

Each night, you may choose a player. The Moderator will tell you that player's alighment: Good or Evil.

In games involving multiple Evil factions, and/or Evil human members of the Wolf/Vampire team(s), this role can be even more powerful than the [Seer](#seer).

## Coward
* **TEAM:** Village
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Good
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** No

You must never vote to eliminate. 

If your final vote for the day does not match the required vote, then you commit suicide at the end of the day.

## Cupid
* **TEAM:** Village
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Good
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** No

At the beginning of the game, you pick two players who will immediately become [Lovers](#lovers). You may pick yourself as one of the Lovers if you like. The Lovers will be made aware of each other via the Moderator, but their true roles (and thus team alliance) are NOT revealed to each other.

## Disciple
* **TEAM:** Village
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Good
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** Yes*

At the start of the game, you'll pick another player to be your Best Friend. That player will NOT be informed of this development. If your Best Friend is killed by any means, you'll become so enraged that you'll kill another player immediately. Obviously, if this happens during the day, the entire village will witness the act.

If you vote for your Best Friend to be executed - *regardless of whether or not that player DOES get executed* - you'll become so consumed by guilt that you'll commit suicide during the following night phase.

## Friendly Neighbor
* **TEAM:** Village
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Good
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** Yes

Each night, you may choose a player. That player will be notified by the Moderator that you are the Friendly Neighbor.

## Diseased
* **TEAM:** Village
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Good
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** No

You suffer from a chronic illness. If you are attacked by
werewolves during the night, you are killed as normal. However, the werewolves will become so ill after devouring you that they will not feed the following night.

The Werewolves are not informed when they kill a Diseased player.
It is very possible that the best thing you can do for your team is make yourself a target of the werewolves.

## Gambler
* **TEAM:** Village
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Good
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** Yes

Each night, you may select a player that you think will be killed by the wolves. If you are right, your next vote during the day will count double.



## Gossip
* **TEAM:** Village
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Good
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** Yes (Once)

On the third night, you will tell the Moderator the names of two living players. The Moderator will tell you one of their roles, but not who the player is that owns the role.

## Grave Digger
* **TEAM:** Village
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Good
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** Yes

Each night, you may select a DEAD player to learn if they were active that night. You do not know if they are good or evil.

## Executioner
* **TEAM:** Village
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Good
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** No

Once per game, you may pardon one player from being executed. The decision to pardon a player must be messaged to the Moderator before the day phase ends. You cannot pardon yourself.

## Hunter
* **TEAM:** Village
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Good
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** Yes

Just before you're killed - by any means - you'll be able to commit one final act of defiance by launching your own attack against any other player in the game. You also have the option of NOT attacking. The decision to attack and the choice of target must happen quickly, and no conferring is allowed. Typically, the Moderator will take you aside, inform you that you're about to be killed, and you'll have several seconds to make a choice. If you take too much time, you'll waive the right to make your retaliatory attack!

## Idiot
* **TEAM:** Village
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Good
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** Yes

What would a village be without an Idiot? You don't know it, but you are loathed by your fellow villagers. In fact, you think you're just another Villager. If you are involved in a tie for execution, there is no tiebreaking procedure. Instead, your fellow villagers will take advantage of this chance to rid themselves of you, and you will be executed!

## Jailkeeper
* **TEAM:** Village
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Good
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** Yes

Each night, you may choose a player. That player is protected (like the [Bodyguard](#bodyguard)), but the "protected" player is also prevented from taking any night-time action (like the [Harlot](#harlot)).

## Lamplighter
* **TEAM:** Village
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Good
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** Yes

Each night, you may choose a player. The Moderator will tell you if that player was active that night.

In addition, once per game during the day, you may choose to learn the role of your target from the previous night.

## Lycan
* **TEAM:** Village
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Good
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** Yes

You are an ordinary member of the village who has been cursed by fate. Because of this, you will be (incorrectly) seen by the [Seer](#seer) as a wolf in an initial scanning. Subsequent scans will correctly reveal that you are in fact NOT a wolf.

## Magician
* **TEAM:** Village
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Good
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** No

You have the ability to detect the race (Human or Wolf) of any deceased character. Your power is PASSIVE and AUTOMATIC. As long as you remain alive, after each death in the game the Moderator will automatically inform the village of the race of the deceased.

## Martyr
* **TEAM:** Village
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Good
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** No

You are a deeply committed soul who is prepared to sacrifice yourself for the good of the village. If you feel that a player is about to be executed unjustly, you may step in and take that player's place. You have to contact the Moderator before the end of the day to indicate that you would like
to use your power. This death cannot be prevented by ANY means.

## Mason
* **TEAM:** Village
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Good
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** No

You have no special powers per se, but you are part of a secret society dating back hundreds of years. Two or three of you will be in the game, and at the start the Moderator will tell you who your Masonic comrades are, and vice versa. You are NOT allowed to disclose your secret membership to the group publically but can inform other players in private.

## Medium
* **TEAM:** Village
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Good
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** No

Once per game, you can hold a seance to speak with a dead player of your choice. Players must vote to have the seance. If a majority votes yes, and the Medium is alive, the seance occurs (whether the Medium wants it to or not). The dead player is allowed to make a statement (Moderator must approve) to the village.

## Misfit
* **TEAM:** Village
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Good
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** Yes

Each night, you may choose a player. The Moderator will show you a role belonging to a different random living player (other than yourself).

**NOTE:** It's possible to see the role belonging to the chosen player if there is another player who also has that role. For example, if you choose to scan a [Villager](#villager), then you may get a Villager result if there are still more than two Villagers in the game.

## Old Hag
* **TEAM:** Village
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Good
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** Yes

Each night, you must pick a player to place a pox on. That player will become so ill that they will not be able to get out of bed the following day, and thus will not be able to vote. Talking and other forms of communication are still allowed. The poxed player will recover during the following night phase, so that only one vote is missed. Being poxed will not alter a player's ability to perform a night action.

You can't pox yourself, and you can't pox the same player on consecutive nights.

## Oracle
* **TEAM:** Village
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Good
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** No

At the end of each night, you learn the role of all players who were killed on the previous night and day (but not the current night).

## Pacifist
* **TEAM:** Village
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Good
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** No

You are viewed as one of the true upstanding citizens of your village, although your fellow villagers are too modest to come right out and tell you that. In fact, you think you're just another [Villager](#villager).

If you're part of a tie for the most votes for execution, you are automatically given the benefit of the doubt and NOT executed. A tiebreaking vote still may be necessary, of course, but it won't involve you...

## Paranoid Villager
* **TEAM:** Village
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Good
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** No

When a player is eliminated by the village, you must have voted to eliminate the player. If your final vote for the day does not match the required vote, then you commit suicide at the end of the day. Required votes can never be None or yourself.

## Partisan
* **TEAM:** Village
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Good
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** Yes

Each night, you may choose a player and you are informed by the Moderator if that player is the [Minion](#minion) or the [Lunatic](#lunatic). The Partisan has no additional special powers, but the Minion and lunatic are powerful allies of the Wolf team.

## Possessed
* **TEAM:** Village
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Good
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** No

Once per game, you may allow a dead player to commune with you for you for one day. You will pick the player and they will cast votes on your behalf. You cannot vote or speak to the group that day. The next day you resume control of yourself.

## Priest
* **TEAM:** Village
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Good
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** No

Every time a player is executed, the Priest learns the alignment (Good or Evil) for that player. It is not announced to the game.

## Regent
* **TEAM:** Village
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Good
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** No

You are the most beloved (or possibly the most feared) member of the village. Once per game, you may single-handedly declare who is to be executed at the end of that day - regardless of the vote count. This declaration can come (via a PM to the Moderator or a public declaration) at any time during that particular day.

Offsetting this power is the fact that if you're killed - by any means - the entire village will automatically go into mourning the following day and not vote to execute anyone. Nighttime activity is not affected.

Due to the nature of the role, your identity will always be revealed upon your death

## Professor
* **TEAM:** Village
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Good
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** Yes

At the end of each night, you are told how many [Werewolves](#werewolf) OR [Vampires](#vampire) (not both) are left. The number of werewolves given will be the number of Pack Hunters that contribute to the night attack.

## Psychic
* **TEAM:** Village
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Good
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** No

Each night you learn the role of a random living player, but not whose role it is. You only learn roles with significant impact on the game (ie, not [Villager](#villager)).

## Saint
* **TEAM:** Village
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Good
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** Yes (Once)

You are a deeply caring individual on the village team. Each night, after all other night actions are resolved, you will be told who is dying that night. You
will NOT be told their alignment or role. After being told this, you will have the option of dying in that person's place. That person will not be told you saved them, and they will not even know they were on death's door. Your cause of death will be identical to the person you saved. This death is viewed as a suicide and cannot be prevented by any means. A role blocker can stop you from sacrificing yourself. You will be informed you were blocked.

## Scientist
* **TEAM:** Village
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Good
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** No

An expert in forensics, you have the ability to determine the cause of death - Wolf attack, blood loss ([Vampire](#vampire) attack), poison ([Witch](#witch) attack), strangling ([Zombie](#zombie) attack), shooting (hunter), burning (the devil), devouring (chupacabra) or stabbing (other human-based attack) - of any deceased character. Once the kill occurs, you immediately make the determination. This ability can give the village a tremendous amount of information - provided you remain alive, of course! 

**Note** that the [Lunatic's](#lunatic) night attack is seen by you as a Wolf attack, even though it was actually committed by a human.

Your special power is PASSIVE and AUTOMATIC; as long as you live, the Moderator will inform all players of the cause of death of any deceased player.

## Sensor
* **TEAM:** Village
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Good
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** No

Each night, you learn how many wolf team members voted for the successful execution on the previous day.

## Shadow
* **TEAM:** Village
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Good
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** Yes

Each night, you may choose a player and the Moderator will inform you if they were active that night. Players that are blocked are not considered active.

## Shaman
* **TEAM:** Village
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Good
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** Yes

Each night, you may choose a player and the Moderator will inform you if that players is a [Cult](#cult-leader) member. You cannot detect if the person is a [Cult Leader](#cult-leader), and you cannot scan yourself.

## Silversmith
* **TEAM:** Village
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Good
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** No

You've got a hand-made silver dagger at your bedside with which you can fend off a single wolf attack. Unfortunately, the dagger will be broken in the struggle, and you won't be able to procure enough silver to make another one for several weeks. In other words, you've got one free pass vs. the wolves, and that's it. The Moderator will inform both you and the attacking wolf/wolves of the unsuccessful attack, but no such details will be provided to the rest of the village. It should be stressed that since it's at your bedside, the dagger cannot fend off a Red Wolf retaliation or other wolf attack during the day. Once you've used the dagger, you're just another plain old [Villager](#villager)...
If for some reason you have either wolfsbane or an amulet of protection (see items), you may inform the moderator you wish to give your dagger to another player. Or you can keep it for yourself. 

## Spellcaster
* **TEAM:** Village
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Good
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** Yes

At night, you may choose to learn any player's role. If you choose a [Werewolf](#werewolf), you are killed by them (in addition to their normal kill). A [Bodyguard](#bodyguard) (or similar protection) may prevent you from being killed in this way.

## Thief
* **TEAM:** Village
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Good
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** Yes

Each night, you may attempt to steal all of the items carried by another player. If the player does not have any items, then you get nothing.

## Tough Villager
* **TEAM:** Village
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Good
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** No

You have a particularly strong constitution. If you are targeted for death at night, you will not die immediately. Instead, you will linger through the following day and finally succumb the night AFTER you were initially targeted. During this one-day reprieve, you will not be aware that you were attacked, and will retain full discussion and voting privileges. If you are protected or otherwise targeted to cheat death the night after you are attacked, you will survive! Note that your special nature only applies to attacks at night; if you are executed, you die immediately.

## Town Crier
* **TEAM:** Village
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Good
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** Yes

Each night, you learn how many players were active that night. Players who were blocked are not considered active that night. This happens automatically, but you also count as being active at night.

## Tracker
* **TEAM:** Village
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Good
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** Yes

Each night, you may choose a player and learn who, if anybody, that player targeted the same night (but not the action the player performed).

## Traveler
* **TEAM:** Village
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Good
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** Yes

Each night, you may choose to leave town. You are back in time to participate in the next game day. On nights that you leave town, you are immune to all night actions targeting them, including kills and scans. You may not choose to leave town two nights in a row.

## Troublemaker
* **TEAM:** Village
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Good
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** Yes (Once)

Once per game, you can elect to "stir up trouble" the following day. When this is done, the Village executes TWO players instead of just one. You must inform the Moderator of your intentions during the night phase prior to the
day on which the extra vote is to take place. If you happen to be killed during that night, the extra vote does NOT take place the following Day.

## Vigilante
* **TEAM:** Village
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Good
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** Yes

You are a professional killer on the side of the Village. Each night, you may elect to kill another player, or not - the kill is not mandatory.

## Watcher
* **TEAM:** Village
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Good
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** Yes

Each night, you may choose a player and learn who else targeted that player that night (but not the actions that were performed). If your target is the player targeted by the wolf team, you are only given the name of the killing member of the wolf team, if this was a pack kill, you are given a random pack-hunter's name.

## Witch
* **TEAM:** Village
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Good
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** Yes (Once)

Once during the game, you are told who the victim of the wolves will be. You can choose to heal them. This is a one-time only event and you must message the Moderator during the day before to activate the power for the next night. You CAN heal yourself. Alternatively, once per game you can cast a protective spell over the whole village for a night which protects everyone from any kill.

## Witch Doctor
* **TEAM:** Village
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Good
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** No

Once per game you can bring back a player who was killed. They return with their previous alignment, but no special abilities.

## Vampire Hunter
* **TEAM:** Village
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Good
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** No

Each night you a choose a player. If that player is a vampire, the moderator tells you "vampire" if that player is any other race, the moderator tells you "not a vampire". In addition, vampires may never eliminate you at night. Any attempts to do so fail, and any attempt to convert you eliminates the vampire in question. 



## Siblings
* **TEAM:** Starts as Village
* **RACE:** Per role
* **ALIGNMENT:** Starts as Good
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** Per role

You and your fellow Sibling are two Villagers that share a special bond. At the start of the game, the Moderator will tell you who your Sibling is (although their role won't be revealed). Both Siblings are guaranteed to be on the side of the village. You and your Sibling will maintain your original roles, with the following important condition: If one of you is executed, the other will switch to the Wolf team instantly, becoming a Betrayer for the remainder of the game.

If you vote to execute your Sibling, you'll be overcome with guilt and commit suicide the following night. 

## Lovers
* **TEAM:** Per role
* **RACE:** Per role
* **ALIGNMENT:** Per role
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** Per role

You and your Lover were chosen by [Cupid](#cupid) at the start of the game. Luckily, you were made aware of each other by the Moderator. This has two important ramifications:
* If one of you is killed by any means, the other will commit suicide instantly.
* If one of you votes to execute the other, the scorned Lover will commit suicide once the vote is made public, which (per the previous rule) will trigger the suicide of the other Lover. Since suicide cannot be prevented by any means, think twice before casting that vote!
* Naturally, your original role and team alliance (if any) still apply, but you won't know if your Lover is fighting for the same cause. Having Lovers on opposite teams can make for some interesting game dynamics!


## Restless Dead (Village Team)
When most roles in this game are eliminated, you stop playing, but in exchange, you can see everything that's going on in the game. The restless dead work differently. These roles can keep affecting the game after their elimination, but they don't get full access to roles and information until after they are done affecting the game. 

### Specter
* **TEAM:** Village
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Good
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** No

You are just an ordinary [Villager](#villager) until you die. Once you are killed by any means, you become a Specter. You function like the ghost, but instead of passing on, you may change every night, which player you are haunting. 


### Zombie
* **TEAM:** Village
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Good
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** Yes

You begin the game as a standard [Villager](#villager), with no special powers. This all changes, however, if you're killed by wolves. Your death is reported normally, but the following night, the Moderator will inform you that you have risen from the dead as a Zombie and must pick a player to strangle as revenge for being killed. You remain allied with the village. This process is repeated for the following two nights, for a total of three Zombie stranglings, after which you turn to dust. Once you have assumed your undead state, you must continue to act like any other dead player. No talking, voting, or other participation in village activities is allowed. Your transformation ONLY takes place as a result of a wolf attack. All other forms of death do not trigger the transformation.

# Wolf Team (Pack hunters)

## Werewolf
* **TEAM:** Werewolf
* **RACE:** Werewolf
* **ALIGNMENT:** Evil
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** Yes

You are one of the Pack Hunters on the Werewolf team. Each night you confer with your fellow Pack Hunters to choose a player to devour. Once you've decided, one of the Pack Hunters will tell the Moderator your choice. 

The first night of the game, the Moderator will tell you the identities of your fellow Pack Hunters. However, only YOU will know what type of wolf you are. It may or may not be advantageous for you to reveal your full identity to your teammates.

## Alpha Wolf
* **TEAM:** Werewolf
* **RACE:** Werewolf
* **ALIGNMENT:** Evil
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** Yes

You are one of the [Pack Hunters](#werewolf) on the Werewolf team. You have one additional passive power: The first time you are scanned by the Seer, you will NOT be seen as a werewolf. However, subsequent Seer scans will reveal the truth, that you are in fact a werewolf.



## Cowardly Wolf
* **TEAM:** Werewolf
* **RACE:** Werewolf
* **ALIGNMENT:** Evil
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** Yes

You are one of the [Pack Hunters](#werewolf) on the Werewolf team, and are also the wolf counterpart to the [Village Coward](#coward). You must never vote to eliminate.

## Dark Wolf
* **TEAM:** Werewolf
* **RACE:** Werewolf
* **ALIGNMENT:** Evil
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** Yes

You are one of the [Pack Hunters](#werewolf) on the Werewolf team. Each night, choose another Werewolf. If the Werewolves do not make a kill (either by choice or because they were blocked), then you kill the Werewolf you chose.

## Dire Wolf
* **TEAM:** Werewolf
* **RACE:** Werewolf
* **ALIGNMENT:** Evil
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** Yes

You are one of the [Pack Hunters](#werewolf) on the Werewolf team. Starting on the 4th Night, you may attack one additional player (by yourself) per night, in addition to taking part in the normal "pack" kill. Because of this, it's in your best interest to wait until the pack has announced its target to the Moderator before selecting a target for your solo kill. Offsetting this powerful ability is an equally powerful weakness: If you are scanned by the [Seer](#seer), you will not merely be revealed as a werewolf - you will be killed! Since all night takes place simultaneously, being scanned will not negate your solo kill during that night.

## Gray Wolf
* **TEAM:** Werewolf
* **RACE:** Werewolf
* **ALIGNMENT:** Evil
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** Yes

You are one of the [Pack Hunters](#werewolf) on the Werewolf team. You have one additional power: Once per game, after the pack's target has been chosen, you may kill one of your fellow Pack Hunters, and the pack's target is transformed into a Werewolf instead of being killed. This can take the heat off of your teammates by replacing a suspicious Pack Hunter.

## Executioner Wolf
* **TEAM:** Werewolf
* **RACE:** Werewolf
* **ALIGNMENT:** Evil
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** Yes

You are one of the [Pack Hunters](#werewolf) on the Werewolf team, and are also the wolf counterpart to the [Village Executioner](#executioner).

## Lone Wolf
* **TEAM:** Werewolf
* **RACE:** Werewolf
* **ALIGNMENT:** Evil
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** Yes

You are one of the [Pack Hunters](#werewolf) on the Werewolf team. Despite this, your ultimate goal is to take over the village for yourself. You can only win the game if you are the sole surviving Pack Hunter AND the Wolf team emerges victorious. In order to do so, you'll need to ensure that your fellow Pack Hunters meet an untimely demise.



## Paranoid Wolf
* **TEAM:** Werewolf
* **RACE:** Werewolf
* **ALIGNMENT:** Evil
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** Yes

You are one of the [Pack Hunters](#werewolf) on the Werewolf team, and are also the wolf counterpart to the Paranoid Villager. You must vote to execute the player that is eliminated each day.. If your final vote for the day does not match the required vote, then you commit suicide at the end of the day. Required votes can never be None or yourself.



## Red Wolf
* **TEAM:** Werewolf
* **RACE:** Werewolf
* **ALIGNMENT:** Evil
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** Yes

You are one of the [Pack Hunters](#werewolf) on the Werewolf team. You have one additional power: If you're executed, just before you die you'll get to kill one player who voted for you. In this respect you're like a highly effective Hunter. 




## Spirit Wolf
* **TEAM:** Werewolf
* **RACE:** Werewolf
* **ALIGNMENT:** Evil
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** Yes

You are one of the [Pack Hunters](#werewolf) on the Werewolf team. If executed, your spirit can still speak with the Wolves, but you can't speak publicly or vote. The Restless Dead rules If you're killed via other means, you don't have this power.



## Usurper
* **TEAM:** Werewolf
* **RACE:** Werewolf
* **ALIGNMENT:** Evil
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** Yes

You are one of the [Pack Hunters](#werewolf) on the Werewolf team. However, you are jealous of the [Alpha Wolf](#alpha-wolf) in your pack. If you are part of a vote that executes the Alpha Wolf, then you become the Alpha Wolf. If the Alpha Wolf dies in any other way, then you become a normal Werewolf. If your team wins the game and one of your pack mates is still an Alpha Wolf, then you lose the
game.

## White Wolf
* **TEAM:** Werewolf
* **RACE:** Werewolf
* **ALIGNMENT:** Evil
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** Yes

You are one of the [Pack Hunters](#werewolf) on the Werewolf team. At the beginning of the game, the Moderator will also tell you the identity of the [Sorcerer](#sorcerer).

## Wolf Campaigner
* **TEAM:** Werewolf
* **RACE:** Werewolf
* **ALIGNMENT:** Evil
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** Yes

You are one of the [Pack Hunters](/werewolf) on the Werewolf team, and are also the wolf counterpart to the [Village Campaigner](#campaigner). You are also good at gaining support for your cause. Twice per game, you may have your vote count double. Do this by telling the moderator before the end of the day.

When you choose to have your vote count double and you end up successfully executing a player, the Moderator will inform everyone that there was a campaigner.

## Wolf Cub
* **TEAM:** Werewolf
* **RACE:** Werewolf
* **ALIGNMENT:** Evil
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** Yes

* **RACE:** Werewolf
* **ALIGNMENT:** Evil
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** Yes

You are one of the [Pack Hunters](#werewolf) on the Werewolf team. You are also a [Seer](#seer) (or a sub-type such as the [Paranoid Seer](#paranoid-seer)). This is useful in games where there are multiple opposing wolf packs



## Wolfwere
* **TEAM:** Werewolf
* **RACE:** Werwolf
* **ALIGNMENT:** Evil
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** Yes

You are one of the [Pack Hunters](#werewolf) on the Werewolf team. However, you are especially weak to psychic forces. If the Seer chooses you as their target, you are killed by the psychic pressure!

# Wolf Team (Non Pack Hunters)

## Butcher
* **TEAM:** Werewolf
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Evil
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** No
You are a human who fights for your new werewolf overlords. Once per game compose a message that "I am the butcher, and I think player 1 is role A, player 2 is role b". The moderator will confirm that you are the butcher to village, and will evaluate every statement one by one (starting with the first statement). If the first statement is true, that player is immediately eliminated (special abilities can prevent this). If that statement is false, the moderator stops parsing. The moderator will continue evaluating statements until you get one incorrect, or you conclude with "and that's all I know". 
You should post the message in one block.  Once your butcher block has been posted, you have no special powers, and just a regular human hoping for a werewolf victory.  
 You don't know who the Werewolves are, and they won't know who you are, either.
## Betrayer
* **TEAM:** Werewolf
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Evil
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** No

You are a villager who possesses no special powers, but your hatred of the village elders means that you'll do anything to change the status quo. In this case, that means aligning yourself with the forces of evil and doing all you can to ensure that the Wolf team achieves victory. The trouble is, at the start of the game you won't know who your Wolf team allies are, and they
won't know who you are, either.


## Copycat
* **TEAM:** Werewolf
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Evil
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** Yes

Each night, choose a player. The first time the Werewolves do not kill (either by choice or because they were blocked), the player you targeted IS killed. You try to emulate the Werewolf killings so it will be seen as though the player was killed by the wolves. You don't know who the Werewolves are, and they won't know who you are, either.

## Harlot
* **TEAM:** Werewolf
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Evil
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** Yes

You're a human who is on the side of the Wolf team. Each night, you may choose a player to distract. Because the targeted character is  occupied that night, they are blocked from performing a night action. The same player cannot be targeted two nights in a row. If the targeted player is a Pack Hunter, the pack makes no kill that night, but you'll be told that you blocked a teammate. If the targeted player is a member of the Wolf team, you'll block that player's ability, but you'll also be told that you blocked a teammate.

At the start of the game, you won't know who your Wolf team allies are, and they won't know who you are, either.

## Lunatic
* **TEAM:** Werewolf
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Evil
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** Yes

You appear to be just another Villager, but you're actually on the side of the Wolf team. Normally, you don't act at night. However, if the Wolf team's kill is somehow prevented, you'll be able to make your own attack the following night. Your attack emulates a wolf attack so convincingly that even the Scientist will think that its victim was killed by werewolves.

At the start of the game, you'll be told who all of the Pack Hunters are, and the Pack Hunters will be told who you are.


## Minion
* **TEAM:** Werewolf
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Evil
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** No

To the outside world you appear to be just another Villager, but you're actually on the side of the Wolf team. At the start of the game, you'll be told which players are the Pack Hunters, and vice versa.

## Saboteur
* **TEAM:** Werewolf
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Evil
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** No

To the outside world you appear to be just another Villager, but you're actually on the side of the Wolf team. You win if the Werewolves win. The Werewolves don't know who you are, and you don't know who they are. 


## Sorcerer
* **TEAM:** Werewolf
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Evil
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** Yes

You're a human who is working to help the Wolf team take over the village. Each Night, you may use your mystical powers to scan a player and the Moderator will tell you if your target is the Seer. If you DO locate the Seer in this fashion, you can use subsequent scan attempts to locate wolves, just like the [Seer](#seer), although in this case you're looking to find your allies, not your enemies. At the start of the game, you will not know who your Wolf team allies are, and those allies (with the exception of the [White Wolf](#white-wolf), if it's in play) won't know you, either.

## Provocateur
* **TEAM:** Werewolf
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Evil
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** No

To the outside world you appear to be just another Villager, but you're actually on the side of the Wolf team. The Wolves do not know your identity and you do not know their identity. However, if one of them is executed, you will then learn the identity of all the remaining Wolves.

## Spy
* **TEAM:** Werewolf
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Evil
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** Yes

Each night, you select a player. If the Werewolves choose to attack you, that player's role is revealed to the Werewolves. There is no kill that night. At the start of the game, you will not know who your Wolf team allies are, and those allies won't know you, either. The first time the Werewolves chose to attack you, they will be told you are the spy (and the identity of the player you chose that night) and you will be told who the current pack-hunters are. 


## Wolfman
* **TEAM:** Werewolf
* **RACE:** Human/Wolf
* **ALIGNMENT:** Evil
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** Yes (if transformed)

You start the game thinking that you're a [Betrayer](#betrayer), an ally of the Werewolf team possessing no special abilities. However, this changes in dramatic fashion if the [Alpha Wolf](#alpha-wolf) becomes the last living Pack Hunter. If this happens, you'll be transformed into a [standard Werewolf](#werewolf) starting the next night phase. At that time, you'll be told the identity of the Alpha Wolf, and vice-versa. For the purposes of the various detection roles like the Seer, you're seen as Human/Evil until after your transformation, when you're detected as Wolf/Evil.

# Advanced Teams

These roles are teams unto themselves, and are working against all other teams.

## Cult Leader
* **TEAM:** Cult
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Evil
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** Yes

You have only one goal: to convert the entire village to "The Cause," one person (or werewolf) at a time. Each night, you'll pick one player to add to the cult. Players thus added are NOT informed of this development, nor can anything be done to prevent it. Such is the allure of The Cause that if the game progresses to the point where the all surviving players are cult members - regardless of their team affiliation - the cult wins. All former affiliations are shrugged off in the name of The Cause. If you are killed, no new admissions to the cult will occur, but your victory conditions still apply.

## Hoodlum
* **TEAM:** None
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Evil
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** Yes

You are a sadistic individual whose goal is to take over the village by eliminating all of your opposition. You are not affiliated with any team.
Each night, you may choose a player to kill. Each kill advances your cause by whittling down the population. You must be eliminated in order for any other team to win the game.

Note: If you have a [Lover](#lover) and you and your Lover are the sole survivors, the game ends and you (and your Lover) win.

## Rival Tailors
* **TEAM:** None
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Good
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** No

You are a villager with no special powers, but even though you are Human and Good, you have no team affiliation. However, there are two Tailors in the village and your village can only economically sustain one. The first night, the Moderator will tell you the name of the other Tailor. In order to win, your rival Tailor must be executed and you must vote to execute them.

* If your rival dies for reasons other than execution during the day, then you become an ordinary villager with the same goals and win conditions as the village.
* If you are killed and your rival is alive, then you lose.
* If both you and your rival are alive at the end of the game, then you lose.
* If your rival is executed and you did not vote for their execution, then you lose.

## Tanner
* **TEAM:** None
* **RACE:** Human
* **ALIGNMENT:** Good
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** No

You are a villager with no special powers, but even though you are Human and Good, you have no team affiliation. Your goal is simply to ride out the current power struggle and survive. If you are still alive when victory conditions are achieved - by any of the various competing factions - you will receive credit for winning.

## Vampire
* **TEAM:** Vampire
* **RACE:** Vampire
* **ALIGNMENT:** Evil
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** Yes

You and your fellow Vampires are another faction aiming to take over the village. Like the werewolf Pack Hunters, you'll confer each evening with your fellow Vampires and target a player to be killed. The first night of the game, the Moderator will tell you the identities of your fellow Vampires. 
When a player is eliminated by the vampires, bloodloss takes time. They wake up with the rest of the village the next day, and can act, vote, etc until the halfway point (24 human hours into the 48 hour cycle) of that day, at which point they are eliminated. 

Each Vampire has a one use per game ability called "conversion":  Inform the moderator you are using your ability. If the vampire's target for the evening would be killed, their role is now neophyte vampire. If the vampire's target was a vampire hunter, you are eliminated. 

Your team's victory conditions are identical to those of the Wolf team with one exception:
If there is a vampire hunter alive in the village, the vampires cannot win. 

##  Neophyte Vampire
* **TEAM:** Vampire
* **RACE:** Vampire
* **ALIGNMENT:** Evil
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** Yes
You and your fellow Vampires are another faction aiming to take over the village. Like the werewolf Pack Hunters, you'll confer each evening with your fellow Vampires and target a player to be killed. The first night of the game, the Moderator will tell you the identities of your fellow Vampires. 
When a player is eliminated by the vampires, bloodloss takes time. They wake up with the rest of the village the next day, and can act, vote, etc until the halfway point (24 human hours into the 48 hour cycle) of that day, at which point they are eliminated. 
You cannot convert other players to the vampire cause. 
Your team's victory conditions are identical to those of the Wolf team with one exception:
If there is a vampire hunter alive in the village, the vampires cannot win.


## Chupacabra
* **TEAM:** Chupacabra
* **RACE:** Chupacabra
* **ALIGNMENT:** Evil
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** Yes

You are hungry. Werewolves are tasty, Villagers and Vampires, less so. Each night you pick another player. If that player is a werewolf they are eliminated. If that player is not a werewolf, nothing occurs.
If no players remain with the race of werewol, every night you choose  a player and that player is eliminated. 
You win if you are the last player, or if you have a lover, you and your lover are the last player (see hoodlum win condition). 
If your lover is a werewolf, and you target them at night they are converted into "lovestruck werewolf" and you are converted into "lovestruck chupacabra"

## Lovestruck Chupacabra
* **TEAM:** Chupacabra Lovers
* **RACE:** Chupacabra
* **ALIGNMENT:** Evil
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** Yes

The only way you can live in this world is for both of you to be the last two standing. 
You and your lover win if you are the last two players remaining.  You wake up every night and pick a player not your lover. If that player is a werewolf, you eliminate them.  If they are not, nothing happens. If no werewolves remain (except for your lover), you eliminate any player. 

## Lovestruck Werewolf
* **TEAM:** Chupacabra Lovers
* **RACE:** Werewolf
* **ALIGNMENT:** Evil
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** Yes

The only way you can live in this world is for both of you to be the last two standing. 
You and your lover win if you are the last two players remaining.   You have abandoned the other pack huneters: You wake up every night and hunt seperately, choosing a player to eliminate. Of course, you and your pack still remember who each other are. 


## Devil
* **TEAM:** Devil
* **RACE:** Devil
* **ALIGNMENT:** Evil
* **NIGHT ACTIVITY:** Sometimes

You are alone, and you wish to destroy the village. You start the game doing nothing at night, but are invulnerable from all sources at night. If anyone picks you for any ability at night, they are eliminated and no other effect or mechanic can prevent this.
You may be eliminated during the day by the village using voting roles. If you would be eliminated during the day for a reason not a vote (see hunter) you are not eliminated, but the entire village witnesses this and know you are the devil. 
If you are alive no other team may Win. 
When all other night killers (werewolves, vampires, hoodlum, chupacabra) have been removed you eliminate one player each night (this elimination can be prevented by normal mechanics). You win if you are the last player, or if you have a lover, you and your lover are the last player (see hoodlum win condition).

# Items

## The Amulet of Protection

The possessor of the Amulet of Protection will be magically spared from death by any means except suicide - once. After the Amulet has worked its magic, it turns to dust. The Moderator will inform the Amulet's owner of their special status at the start of the game. The Amulet protects against only ONE death. If the holder is the target of multiple attacks during the same game phase, only one of them will be prevented, which will undoubtedly translate into the holder's demise.

## Aura Stone

The possessor of an Aura Stone may use it once at night (including the night 0 that happens at the same time as day 1) to pick 3 other players. If any of those players have an evil alignment, the ball reveals "evil". If all are good, the ball reveals "human". The stone cannot be traded, and once used crumbles to dust. If the stone is used after the 2nd night, it can only target two players, rather than three. 

## Coffee

The possessor of the Coffee may use it to restore a once-per-game ability to themselves. The Moderator will inform the Coffee owner of their special status at the start of the game. It is possible to give Coffee to other players. If you want to do this, let the Moderator know who you want to give the Coffee to.

## Crsyal Ball

The possessor of a Crystall Ball may use it at night (including the night 0 that happens at the same time as day 1) to pick 3 other players. If any of those players race other than human, the ball reveals "non-human". If all are human, the ball reveals "human". The ball cannot be traded, and once used crumbles to dust. If the ball is used after the 2nd night, it can only target two players, rather than three.


## Wolfsbane

The possessor of Wolfsbane will be magically spared from death by wolf attacks, once. The Moderator will inform the Wolfsbane owner of their special status at the start of the game.
