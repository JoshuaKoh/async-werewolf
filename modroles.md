# Overall Point values
Bezier games ultime werewolf has point values for many common roles, so when balancing a two faction game, you can use those values with the addendum of the "phantom werewolf", which is that private conversations in an async format benefit teams who start with information (like werewolves), so there should always be at least one werewolf is looking to betray the rest of the wolves, either intentionally, like the lone wolf, or accidentally like the dark wolf. 


# Village Team

## Villager

Unless the butcher is in play, half of the players of the game should start the game thinking they are a villager. 
Generally, it takes 4-6 villagers to equal one werewolf, vampire, etc.  The more power roles there are, the stronger each villager is. 


### Cursed
the cursed should be considered hurting the village by the equivalent of 1 villager in a large game, or 2 to 3 villagers in a small game.  It's important that unlike the diseased, the cursed no know what they are (because many players prefer being werewolves and get themselves eaten to have more fun. )


### Doppleganger
the doppleganger (like the shapshifter) make the game less swingy, by making the first kill of a power role less important. 

### Drunk
Drunk adds chaos, and doesnt help either team. 

### Ghost
Villager, helps little more than a regular villager. 

### Shapeshifter
see doppleganger. 


## Seer
Seer, or a varient, is the most common role in the game. The seer is roughlty equivelent to a werewolf. 

### Apprentice Seer
half a seer, good role

### Insane Seer
in a large enough game, the insanse seer has the same value as a normal seer (because it's always wrong)

### Naive Seer
hurts the village a lot. Don't play without a real seer as well.

### Paranoid Seer
hurts the village a lot. Don't play without a real seer as well.

## Bodyguard
Slows down the game, but is the 2nd most common good role (after seer) for a reason. Don't run more than 2 of them. 

### Amateur Bodyguard
with a real bodyguard in the game as well, assume they will be as effective as a 2nd real bodyguard. 

### Sacrificial Bodyguard
with a real bodyguard in the game as well, assume they will be as effective as a 2nd real bodyguard. 



### Paranoid Bodyguard
with a real bodyguard in the game as well, assume they will be as effective as a 2nd real bodyguard. 



## Alchemist
See lovers. Add chaos and speeds up the game. 



## Aura Seer
With a real seer or another "seer like role" easily the strongest role in the game. 

## Campaigner
good role for new palyers

## Clairvoyant
The single strongest village role. 

## Coward
hurts the village, but provides interesting claims. 

## Cupid
on average provides no value to village, but allows for interesting interactions. usually makes the game more "Swingy"

## Disciple
fun role. 

## Friendly Neighbor
stronger than it seems. Often as good as bodyguard. 

## Diseased
This great for newer players to teach that "dying can be how to help your team win". A diseased claiming to be the seer, and then getting eaten on the first night is one of the single strongest plays in the game. 

## Gambler
fun role. doesn't affect balance much. 



## Gossip
consided modifying this to the 2nd night. 

## Grave Digger
Not as good as a seer if you have species reveal on by default. 

## Executioner
assume the execution will hurt the village. 

## Hunter
2 or 3 hunters in a game is a great way to speed up the game. 

## Idiot
hurts the village slightly. 

## Jailkeeper
as good a bodyguard, possibly better with the hoodlum, cult leader, etc in the game. Much worse if no evil humans. 

## Lamplighter
As good as a seer.

## Lycan
Hurts the village a lot. Only consider if multiple scanners on the village team. 

## Magician
I recommend this role be passive and village wide. If not, the magician is the single strongest role in the game. 

## Martyr
makes the game less swingy, but not that good. 

## Mason
If there are lots of new players in your group, there should be masons. 

## Medium
I recommend against this role unless the players are really good at following the spirit of werewolf. 

## Misfit




## Old Hag
Adds chaos. Doesn't help the village. 

## Oracle
very very strong. 

## Pacifist
adds chaos, low mechanical complexity. 

## Paranoid Villager
adds chaos, low mechanical complexity. 


## Partisan
Helpful  for balance with a minion. Auto-include with a lunatic. 

## Possessed


## Priest
Very strong role. With 3 or more evil times, consider this or the scanner version for game balance. 

## Regent
hurts the village team a surprising amount. Greatly speeds up the game. 

## Professor
be prepared to explain how the "or" works in a game with both factions. 

## Psychic
the greater delta between number of possible roles and roles in the game, the more important this role is.

## Siblings
tbd

## Lovers
This role causes the most chaos, but the most intresesting emergent experiences of almost any role. 

## Restless Dead (Village Team)
Think twice about having too many restless dead players. Being a restless dead is often less fun than being in the ghosts room. 

### Specter
see above


### Zombie
see above

# Wolf Team (Pack hunters)
if you've run a lot of ultimate werewolf, ultimate werewolf legacy or mafia, it's important to note that the wolf team is likely stronger than you expect. Being able to have private side conversations is not allowed in normal werewolf, and being free of this limiation often helps the wolves. 
## Werewolf
Having 3 werewolves who are told it's possible there is a "lone wolf" in the game is often as effective as having a lone wolf in the game.

## Alpha Wolf
This ability is very strong. Do not use without a wolf betrayer of some some sort. 



## Cowardly Wolf
tbd

## Dark Wolf
tbd

## Dire Wolf
tbd

## Gray Wolf
tbd


## Executioner Wolf



## Lone Wolf
this should be a very common role. 


## Paranoid Wolf

be clear about restless dead rules before playing this role. 


## Usurper
tbd

## White Wolf
tbd

## Wolf Campaigner
tbd

## Wolf Cub
tbd

## Wolf Seer
tbd



## Wolfwere
tbd

# Wolf Team (Non Pack Hunters)

## Betrayer
tbd.

## Butcher
This role radically shifts the dynamic of the game. This allows for far more power roles in play without the game becoming a solvable logic puzzle.  

## Copycat
tbd

## Harlot
tbd

## Lunatic
tbd

## Minion
tbd

## Saboteur
tbd

## Sorcerer
tbd

## Provocateur
tbd

## Spy

## Wolfman
tbd

# Advanced Teams

Dont have 3 teams with less than 12 players. Dont have 4 teams with less thatn 18 players.  5 at 24, 6 at 30. If at least half of the players have not played iterated werewolf of some form before, split 24 players into 2 12 player villages/games. 

## Cult Leader
tbd

## Hoodlum
With large (15+ games), a hoodlum should almost always be in the game. They increase the speed of the early game by 50% on average, and they prevent a runaway victory for either village or wolf team. 

## Rival Tailors
tbd

## Tanner
tbd

## Vampire
Vampires are 1.5-2 times as strong  as werewolves. (so if there are 4 werewolves, there should be 2 vampies ). Do not play vampires without the vampire hunter, or an evil scanner of some kind. 

##  Neophyte Vampire
Make it clear to players that a role change does change what team they are on. 


## Chupacabra
unlike the hoodlum, which is just an agent of chaos, the chupacabra can be balanced as a seer or bodyguard on the side of the village in most games. 

## Lovestruck Chupacabra
This team is very strong (because they know who every werewolf is, and the werewolves don't know who the chupacabra is), but fragile.

## Lovestruck Werewolf
see above


## Devil
This role increases the games speed/lethality significantly. You need 3 or more scanners, or 5 or more villagers with scan items for the devil to not have a very good chance of winning. 

# Items

## The Amulet of Protection

Slows the game down. Good item to give people who are eliminated early in the previous game. 

## Aura Stone

stronger than the crystal ball.  

## Coffee
coffee is stronger than it initially seems: in a game with vampires you can double the number of vampires. 

## Crsyal Ball

having at least 2 of these will make day 1 far more interesting. 

## Wolfsbane

see amulet of protection.
