# How to moderate a game 
Every day phase, set up the voting thread. 
Answer any rules questions publicly so all players can see the answers. 
Every night phase, collect all of actions from every player, then resolve them. 

# How to setup a game
See [moderator role information](/modroles) for details, but the things you want to keep in mind are:
Game speed: Roles with more elimination potential speed up the game.  adding 4 or more factions can make a 30 person game move at a reasonable pace. 
Role balance: Each multiple player faction should have roughlty 
Information Balance: In async werewolf, roles that know each other early on can (and will) form private chats. There being seperate victory conditions (such as lone wolf) is key to werewolfs not having too strong of an advantage. 

Logic Puzzle Vs Trusth excercise: If the butcher is not in play, if there are too many named roles, a very dominant strategy is for every player to claim their role, and players who don't claim/ have a contridiction are eliminated one by one. This style of play is not recommended for async games, because the logic puzzle can be "solved". Instead it is recommended that one of the following occurs:
there is a 1:1 ration of village (or start the game believing they are a villager) to non villager good roles. 
The butcher is in play. 
There pack hunters are told 3 roles at the begining of the game that are not in play. 

# Decide on gamewide rules

##  deciding on the role pool

1. pick the roles yourself. [moderator role information](/modroles) is about why you might pick certain roles to be in the game. 

2. Ask players to suggest roles, and pick from that subset. 

3. here is an example role pool table for 8-15 players who are new to werewolf

werewolf
lone wolf
villager 
seer
bodyguard
villager
villager
villager 
werewolf
hunter
diseased
werewolf
mason
mason
villager
apprentice seer
villager 




##  telling players the role pool
There are three ways to tell players the role pool. 
1. is exact role pool. make sure there are a lot of villagers, or the butcher in play before using this. This is a good choice when most players have a similar experience level. 
2. is role pool+n, pick a number of roles (including villager multiple times) equal the number of players +3.  This is the generic choice. 
3. distributed role pool: Tell each player on night 0, 1 other role in the game. On night 1, tell all players the number of teams in the game. On night 2, tell all players the starting roll list, or starting roll list +1/+2. 

## town types
There is traditionally role reveal, team reveal, etc in werewolf. Because those functions are within roles (the magician, the scientist, etc), decide if any of those abilities are gamewide and passive. 
Playing without either team reveal or species reveal is very very hard on the village. Playing with full role reveal is very hard on the werewolves. 

## items
Decide which players start the game with items. 
Items are a great way to reward players who were eliminated early in a previous game, or a way to balance players with different experience levels. 

# How to resolve interactions
## Timing
In an async game, most things are assumed to happen " at the same time during the phase". This means, for example, that if a player is eliminated, but their role changed the state of the game, that state change goes through. 
As an example, a bodyguard who is eliminated at night still protects their target. 


## Information
In general, when interpreting a rule, the interpretation that gives the werewolves or vampires more information is correct, and the interpretation that gives any other faction more information is not.
